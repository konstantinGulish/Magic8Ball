Friday Project: Magic 8 Ball

Create a program that mimics the Magic 8 Ball. If you don't know what a Magic 8 Ball is ... it's a toy ball containing a clear 'window'. You shake the ball and ask it a question. A random response rises to the window. You can read about the Magic 8 Ball on Wikipedia (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site..

Your program will prompt the user for a question and select a random answer from the list below. See the required output below the responses.

● It is certain
● It is decidedly so
● Without a doubt
● Yes definitely
● You may rely on it
● As I see it, yes
● Most likely
● Outlook good
● Yes
● Signs point to yes
● Reply hazy try again
● Ask again later
● Better not tell you now
● Cannot predict now
● Concentrate and ask again
● Don't count on it
● My reply is no
● My sources say no
● Outlook not so good
● Very doubtful

 

Display the question and the answer to the user.

Implement a while loop as described in  https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1340469/assignments/8587331?module_item_id=17424221 to allow the user to continue asking questions until the user types "n".
